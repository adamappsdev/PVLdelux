# PVLdelux
A personal virtual library (PVL) app built in C.

The "delux" suffix is added as a tongue-in-cheek gesture.

## Use Case
One of the most life-changing discoveries of my life was when I began reading well-written books. It has become a sort-of hobby of mine to collect genres or lists of books to read later on websites such as Goodreads. However, while Goodreads is a functionally elegant website, some aspects of the design and application when making your own lists don't match my own needs.

In particular, I tend to collect lists of books based on a specific genre and/or with an idea in mind. Most usually - I make the case for both. However, Goodreads does not have a "genre" selection for your own personally-curated lists, only a title.
Additionally, a short description of what the list is about or what are you supposed to get out of reading all these books is nice, too.

## C
I've been introduced to C through the publically-posted CS50 lectures from Harvard. I've decided to use C for this specific app because of its good performance as well as unversality of ideas, which can be translated into other coding languages with ease. Additionally, there's something very visceral when you code in C, perhaps because it's closer to Assembly-level code than other popular languages.
